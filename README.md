# Terraform Best Practices for AWS API Gateway V1 and Lambda

This repository contains comprehensive guidelines and best practices for deploying AWS API Gateway (REST API) and Lambda functions using Terraform. These documents serve as corporate standards for infrastructure as code implementation.

## Overview

AWS API Gateway and Lambda provide a powerful serverless architecture for building scalable, maintainable APIs. This documentation focuses on:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices using Terraform
- Secure, scalable, and maintainable API Gateway configurations
- Lambda function deployment and management
- Proper IAM permissions and security considerations
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Cost optimization strategies

## Documentation

### Core Services

### Supporting Documentation

- [IAM Best Practices](iam.md) - Security guidelines for IAM roles and policies for Lambda and API Gateway
- [Monitoring and Observability](monitoring.md) - CloudWatch, X-Ray, and logging best practices
- [Provider Configuration](provider.md) - AWS provider setup, authentication, and state management

- [Outputs and Documentation](outputs.md) - Recommended outputs and documentation for your Terraform configurations
- [CI/CD Integration](cicd.md) - Guidelines for integrating Terraform with CI/CD pipelines

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed (version 1.0.0 or later)
2. Configure your AWS credentials properly
3. Review the [provider configuration guidelines](provider.md)
4. Follow the specific service guidelines for [API Gateway](api_gateway.md) and [Lambda](lambda.md)

## Best Practices Overview

- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent, descriptive naming patterns for all resources
- **State Management**: Implement remote state with proper locking mechanisms
- **Security**: Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and enable appropriate encryption
- **Environment Separation**: Use Terraform workspaces or separate state files for different environments
- **Tagging Strategy**: Implement comprehensive tagging for cost allocation and resource management
- **Modularity**: Create reusable modules for common patterns
- **Versioning**: Version your infrastructure alongside your application code
- **Documentation**: Document your infrastructure thoroughly with descriptions and comments
